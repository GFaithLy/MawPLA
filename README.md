#Source data processing
To get the .csv file for training and testing, you can use the code generated in the ". /data/pre-code" file.

#Data pre-processing
The data preprocessing method in this paper is borrowed from the paper: Physicochemical graph neural network for learning protein-ligand interaction fingerprints from sequence data. Nat Mach Intell , vol. 2024.
The protein and ligand preprocessing files "ligand.pt, protein.pt" can be obtained from the ligand_init.py and protein_init.py in "https://github.com/huankoh/PSICHIC/utils".
